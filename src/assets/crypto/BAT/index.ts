  summary: 'A very common question when it comes to Basic Attention Token (BAT) is: “Why would Brave Browser need a token (BAT) for this?”. And the answer lies within Brave’s unusual, yet respectful approach to digital advertising. Brave’s advertisements are privacy centric (does not track the user), and are opt-in only (you only see it if you choose to). ',
