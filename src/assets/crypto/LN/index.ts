  summary: `
  Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that brings off-chain data into an on-chain format, bridging the gap between the isolated blockchain and real-world data.
  It aims to ensure that the external information (pricing, weather data, event outcomes) fed to smart contracts remains untampered with.
  Chainlink is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and Chainlink (LINK) is the native token of the protocol. LINK is used to pay Chainlink network operators for their services.
