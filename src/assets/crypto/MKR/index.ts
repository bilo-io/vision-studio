  summary: 'Maker is a smart contract lending platform that enables users to take out loans by locking-in collateral in exchange for Dai. It was founded by the Maker Foundation in 2015 as an open-source project to offer economic freedom and opportunities to anyone, anywhere. In 2017, it launched the Maker governance token (MKR) and its first stablecoin iteration known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which used Ether (ETH) as collateral.'
