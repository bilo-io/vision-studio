  summary: 'Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on the popular "Doge" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. Dogecoin is a Litecoin fork. Introduced as a "joke currency" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined.',
