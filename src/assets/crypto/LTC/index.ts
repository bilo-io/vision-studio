  summary: 'Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that is largely similar to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, Litecoin is also a decentralized cryptocurrency which utilizes similar protocols as Bitcoin except for a few parameter tweaks. Much like Bitcoin, Litecoin also relies on proof-of-work for consensus and operates on a permissionless peer-to-peer network where users are able to transfer funds to one another without the need to rely on any central authority.',
